## Overview
Shopify CMS is a flexible, cloud-based system that allows eCommerce businesses to manage both product data and content on their online store. While Shopify is best known for its eCommerce capabilities, the CMS also supports non-product content like blogs, landing pages, and customer interactions. Through Shopify's CMS, businesses can create and customize content to optimize for SEO, engage with customers, and enhance their online store experience.

Shopify's ease of use makes it an attractive option for business owners who want to sell online but don't have extensive technical expertise.

## Types of Shopify CMS
Shopify CMS provides several content management tools for building and customizing an online store:

### Online Store Content Management
This is the primary content management interface used by store owners. It includes managing product pages, collections, customer pages, blogs, and additional content like static pages (e.g., About Us, FAQs).

### Blog Management
Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that allows store owners to create blog posts for content marketing, SEO, and customer engagement. This feature is important for boosting organic search visibility and promoting products.

### Custom Pages
Store owners can create and customize pages for specific purposes like landing pages, contact forms, or informational pages. These pages can be organized via navigation menus for easy access.

### Product Collections
Shopify allows businesses to group products into collections, which makes it easy for customers to browse categories (e.g., "Men's Clothing" or "Summer Sale"). Collections can be set manually or automatically based on product tags or conditions.

### Liquid Templating
Shopify’s templating language, Liquid, enables developers to customize the layout and structure of product pages, blogs, and other content types. This flexibility is ideal for businesses with specific design and content needs.
