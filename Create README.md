On GitHub, adding topics to a repository helps categorize and tag it, making it easier for others to find your project based on its purpose or technology stack. Here’s how to do it:

Steps to Add Topics to a GitHub Repository
Go to Your Repository:

Navigate to the repository where you want to add topics.
Access the Repository Settings:

On the main page of the repository, click the "Settings" tab (near the top right).
Edit the Topics Section:

Scroll to the "About" section on the repository's main page (it’s usually in the top-left corner).
If you are already in the repository settings, locate the "Topics" field.
Click the pencil/edit icon next to the "Topics" section.
Add Relevant Topics:

Enter keywords that describe your project (e.g., wordpress, cms, php, open-source, e-commerce).
Press Enter after each topic to save it.
Save Changes:

Changes are automatically saved after you add or remove topics.
Best Practices for Topics
Use relevant and specific keywords.
Keep topics concise (1-2 words per topic).
Use lowercase letters (GitHub standardizes them).
Add technologies, frameworks, or functionalities (e.g., php, mysql, blog, woocommerce).
Example Topics for a WordPress Repository
For a WordPress-related project, here are example topics you might include:

wordpress
cms
php
mysql
